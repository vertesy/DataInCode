Description: DataInCode is a set of R functions that allows you to store
    (smaller) data objects in your R code - make your script fully
    reproducible yet easily sharable. Think of it as an extended version
    of dput(), where you can parse data objects into the code that
    generates them.  DataInCode also contains a set of clipboard
    interaction functions.
